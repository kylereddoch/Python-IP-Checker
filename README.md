Simply run this script and it will check your IP.

This script uses the requests package to make the HTTP request. You need both pip and pipenv installed in your environment.

### Pip

To install pip: [https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

### Pipenv

Once you have pip installed, you can install pipenv.

To install it, run:

```cmd
pip install --user pipenv
```

Now that you have pipenv installed, you can run:

```cmd
pipenv install requests
```

Python packages are installed in the virtual environment. So you will need to install the package in the project directory.
